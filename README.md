# Blockchains
Starting my journey of Blockchains and Smart Contracts.

This is a beginner friendly implementation of Blockchains in Python.

# Module 1
Creates a blockchain in Python using Hashlib, Flask. User can mine a block, get the full chain and also check for validity of the chain.
  1. Deploy locally on your machine.
  2. User-friendly Postman could be used for GET and POST requests.

# Module 2
This module takes previous module to the next step, decentralized the blockchain also there is this dummy cryptocurrency "Pycoin" which users can exchange.
  1. As mentioned above it too deploys on localhost.
  2. The other users get deployed on different ports through different consoles.

# Module 3
Implemented an ICO(Initial Coin Offering) for Pycoin. Investers can buy/sell equities in Pycoin.
  1. Two applications are needed in this module.
  2. Ganache for seeing blocks, transactions and addresses.
